This sample shows the different components are placed inside the scroll panel.
All of the components (in this case these are LwList, LwTextField, LwGrid) implement
the special interface that provides more flexible way to organize the scrolling.
For example, LwTextField component scrolls its view and when you move the
text caret out of the visible area the scroll panel will be notified by the
text field component about the fact.
