This sample shows how to make the child component to be transparent for
the mouse events. There are two child buttons, the first is event transparent.
It means, that events goes through the child as if the component does not exist.
Press over the button and you will see that parent changes its border (the button
does not react). The second child component is event opaque button. It works as
usual.
