This sample demonstrates the possibility of the opening modal and not modal
windows from the other windows. The sample illustrates the modal windows stack.
For example, a modal window is opened from the another modal window, after that
from the last opened modal window we open several MDI widows. It is impossible to
switch to the parent modal window, but it is possible to navigate among the last
opened modal window and the MDI windows.
