This sample shows how the mouse cursor can be customized.
Move the mouse cursor into the black rectangle it will be changed to the HAND cursor
type. The sample controls the cursor type by the LwCursorManager usage. The both
samples (the previous cursor customization sample) does the same thing but using
different methods.
