This sample shows how to create own layout manager.
The sample layout manager divides a container area to four parts:
left top corner, right top corner, left bottom corner and right bottom corner.
Each of the parts can be used to place a child component. To determine what
part of the container area should be used for a given child component the
sample layout provides four constants.
